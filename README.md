# Cubo: An experimental implementation of a container orchestrator in go

The idea is to 
- develop the basic components of an orchestrator, 
- start and stop containers, 
- schedule containers on a node and 
- manage a cluster of worker nodes.

The whole thing should run on a MAC and use the Podman API.
